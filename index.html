                    <h2>Introduction</h2>

                    <p>
                        Hi there, my name is Callum Anderson I am currently 19 years old studying Computer Science at the University of East Anglia in the UK. 
                        Outside of term times I reside in Suffolk where I live with my family.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From a young age I have always been interested in technology, 
                        this was sparked by owning my first computer at the age of seven this started with gaming but as I matured it grew into hobbyist 
                        programming in mainly Python where I would create text based adventure games, albeit very inefficiently. From the age of roughly fourteen I knew 
                        Computer Science was for me.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At British Telecomms I worked with the research team to create a DIY conference camera so they could undergo calls with their co-team in Belfast 
                        with three-hundred and sixty degree video. This DIY device we produced would be placed in the centre of a meeting a table and broadcast each image to the 
                        team in Belfast to ensure that every team member could be seen as well as heard.

                        This website allows users to register, login and post project suggestions which must be approved by an admin in order to be displayed. It uses Flask as its web-framework and a
                        PostgreSQL database to store users details such as username, password (hashed), and role as well as post details such as title, description and whether it is approved.

                    <p>
                        A simple Java class based program to model a book invetory manager, the book class holds attributes which define a book e.g. title, author, ISBN etc. it also implements 
                        the comparable interface to easily sort the books by release year. The inventory class contains a list of books with comparators to help sort the list of books, 
                        it can also perform basic calculations such as total inventory value.
