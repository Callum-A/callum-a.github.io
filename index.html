                    <h2>Introduction</h2>

                    <p>
                        Hi there, my name is Callum Anderson I am currently 18 years old studying Computer Science at the University of East Anglia in the UK. 
                        Outside of term times I reside in Suffolk where I live with my family.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From a young age I have always been interested in technology, 
                        this was sparked by owning my first computer at the age of seven this started with gaming but as I matured it grew into hobbyist 
                        programming in mainly Python where I would create text based adventure games, albeit very inefficiently. From the age of roughly fourteen I knew 
                        Computer Science was for me.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

                    <h3>British Telecomms</h3>

                    <p>
                        At British Telecomms I worked with the research team to create a DIY conference camera so they could undergo calls with their co-team in Belfast 
                        with three-hundred and sixty degree video. This DIY device we produced would be placed in the centre of a meeting a table and broadcast each image to the 
                        team in Belfast to ensure that every team member could be seen as well as heard.
